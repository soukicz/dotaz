## Decisions Log

<!-- Record architectural and implementation decisions here.
     Format: date, context, decision, rationale. -->

| Date | Issue | Decision | Rationale |
|------|-------|----------|-----------|
| 2026-02-28 | DOTAZ-002 | Use dot-notation method names in RPC schema (e.g. `connections.list`) | Matches ARCHITECTURE.md naming, keeps schema organized by domain |
| 2026-02-28 | DOTAZ-002 | Import `RPCSchema` from `electrobun/bun` in shared types | Consistent with Electrobun template patterns; type is available from both `electrobun/bun` and `electrobun/browser` |
| 2026-02-28 | DOTAZ-004 | Use `bun:sqlite` Database directly for app storage (not `Bun.SQL`) | App storage uses synchronous `bun:sqlite` API for simplicity; `Bun.SQL` reserved for user database drivers |
| 2026-02-28 | DOTAZ-004 | Lazy import of `electrobun/bun` Utils in `getDefaultDbPath()` | Avoids Electrobun dependency in tests; tests pass custom `:memory:` path |
| 2026-02-28 | DOTAZ-005 | Use `Bun.SQL` (`new SQL("sqlite:path")`) for SQLite driver | Unified API per ARCHITECTURE.md; supports tagged templates and `unsafe()` for raw SQL |
| 2026-02-28 | DOTAZ-005 | Detect `isAutoIncrement` via single INTEGER PRIMARY KEY heuristic | SQLite's `INTEGER PRIMARY KEY` is a ROWID alias; only applies for single-column PKs |
| 2026-02-28 | DOTAZ-006 | Use `reserve()` for transactions in PostgresDriver | Bun.SQL with pooled connections (`max > 1`) rejects raw `BEGIN`/`COMMIT`/`ROLLBACK` via `unsafe()`; `reserve()` pins a single connection |
| 2026-02-28 | DOTAZ-006 | Use `SQL.Query.cancel()` for query cancellation | Bun.SQL's native cancel mechanism; sets `cancelled` flag but may not interrupt PG backend in Bun 1.3.9 |
| 2026-02-28 | DOTAZ-006 | Detect PG `isAutoIncrement` via `nextval(` in `column_default` | SERIAL/BIGSERIAL columns have default `nextval('sequence_name'::regclass)` |
| 2026-02-28 | DOTAZ-007 | Use listener pattern for status change events | Simple callback pattern (`onStatusChanged`) allows RPC handlers (DOTAZ-008) to hook in without coupling ConnectionManager to Electrobun RPC |
| 2026-02-28 | DOTAZ-007 | ConnectionManager takes AppDatabase via constructor injection | Enables testing with in-memory AppDatabase without singletons |
| 2026-02-28 | DOTAZ-008 | Lazy import of `electrobun/bun` in `createRPC()` | Avoids Electrobun dependency in tests; `createHandlers()` is exported separately for direct testing |
| 2026-02-28 | DOTAZ-008 | Extracted `createHandlers()` from `createRPC()` | Allows testing handler logic directly without Electrobun runtime; handlers are thin delegation wrappers |
| 2026-02-28 | DOTAZ-009 | Namespace wrapper over flat RPC methods | `rpc.connections.list()` instead of `rpc.request["connections.list"]({})` — ergonomic API for stores/components |
| 2026-02-28 | DOTAZ-009 | Use `as any` for message listener registration | Electrobun's `addMessageListener` typing uses `RemoteSchema["messages"]` which maps to the webview side's messages (empty); bun-sent messages require cast |
| 2026-02-28 | DOTAZ-011 | Use `crypto.randomUUID()` for tab IDs instead of nanoid | No external dependency needed; UUID is available in both browser and Bun runtimes |
| 2026-02-28 | DOTAZ-011 | Module-level singleton store pattern | Export `tabsStore` object with getters + actions from module scope; Solid.js `createStore` at module level provides app-wide singleton |
| 2026-02-28 | DOTAZ-012 | Schema tree stored per-connection in connections store | `schemaTrees` keyed by connection ID; auto-loaded on `connected` status event from backend |
| 2026-02-28 | DOTAZ-013 | SSL field as boolean checkbox (not dropdown) | `PostgresConnectionConfig.ssl` is `boolean`; dropdown modes (disable/require/prefer) would need type change, kept aligned with existing type |
| 2026-02-28 | DOTAZ-013 | DB type switcher disabled when editing | Prevents type change on existing connections which would invalidate stored config |
| 2026-02-28 | DOTAZ-014 | Use `Utils.openFileDialog` for both open and save dialogs | Electrobun doesn't expose a native save dialog API; save uses directory picker + `defaultName` |
| 2026-02-28 | DOTAZ-014 | Convert `filters[].extensions` to `*.ext` glob format | Electrobun's `allowedFileTypes` expects comma-separated glob patterns like `*.db,*.sqlite` |

## Lessons Learned

<!-- Capture insights, gotchas, and patterns discovered during implementation.
     These help avoid repeating mistakes and accelerate future work. -->

### Electrobun / Bun
<!-- Runtime quirks, RPC patterns, build issues, etc. -->
- Webview RPC: `Electroview.defineRPC<Schema>()` returns an rpc object; must call `new Electroview({ rpc })` to set up the transport
- `rpc.request["method.name"](params)` is properly typed for bun-side requests from the webview
- `rpc.addMessageListener` on webview side types against `Schema["webview"]["messages"]` (not bun messages) — use `as any` for bun-sent messages like `connections.statusChanged`

### Solid.js / Frontend
<!-- Reactivity pitfalls, store patterns, component patterns, etc. -->

### Database Drivers
<!-- Bun.SQL behavior, PostgreSQL vs SQLite differences, query building, etc. -->
- `Bun.SQL` SQLite URL format: `sqlite::memory:` for in-memory, `sqlite:/path/to/file.db` for file
- `db.unsafe(sql, params)` returns array-like result; use `[...result]` to spread into plain array
- `result.count` gives affected rows for DML, row count for SELECT
- No `.columns` property on Bun.SQL results — infer column names from `Object.keys(rows[0])`
- Both `?` and `$1` param styles work for SQLite via Bun.SQL
- PRAGMA queries accept double-quoted identifiers: `PRAGMA table_info("tablename")`
- `PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON` must be set per connection (not persistent in SQLite)
- Bun.SQL PostgreSQL connection pool rejects raw `BEGIN`/`COMMIT`/`ROLLBACK` via `unsafe()` — use `db.reserve()` for transaction-pinned connections
- `SQL.Query.cancel()` sets `cancelled: true` but the promise may not resolve/reject in Bun 1.3.9 — PG backend process not actually interrupted
- PG `information_schema.columns` returns `data_type` as `'ARRAY'` for array types and `'USER-DEFINED'` for custom types (jsonb, etc.) — map using `udt_name`
- PG `array_agg()` results from Bun.SQL may be returned as native JS arrays or `{a,b,c}` strings — handle both

# Dotaz — Product Requirements Document

## 1. Product Vision

**Dotaz** is a desktop database client focused on working with data. It offers a modern alternative to DataGrip with an emphasis on clean UX, speed, and efficiency in viewing, editing, and querying data.

The application **is not** a schema management tool (DDL) — it focuses exclusively on DML operations and read-only viewing of database structure.

## 2. Target Audience

Developers (backend/fullstack) who need quick, reliable, and clear access to data in databases during development and debugging.

## 3. Platform and Technology

- **Desktop app** built on **Electrobun** (Bun backend + system webview)
- Frontend: framework of choice (React/Solid/Vue + Vite)
- Communication frontend ↔ backend via Electrobun RPC

## 4. Supported Databases (v1)

| Database   | Connection                   |
|------------|------------------------------|
| PostgreSQL | Connection string / host+port+db |
| SQLite     | Path to file                 |

Architecture must account for extensibility to other databases (MySQL, MariaDB, ClickHouse, etc.).

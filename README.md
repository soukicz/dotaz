## What is Dotaz?

Dotaz is a database client that gets out of your way. It focuses on what you do most — looking at data, editing rows, and running queries. It deliberately skips schema management (CREATE TABLE, ALTER, migrations) to keep things simple and fast.

It runs in three modes:

| Mode        | How it works                                                                             |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Desktop** | Native app via [Electrobun](https://electrobun.dev/) — Bun backend with a system webview |
| **Web**     | Bun HTTP/WebSocket server with a browser frontend                                        |
| **Demo**    | Fully in-browser with WASM SQLite — no server, no setup                                  |

## Features

**Data grid** — Virtualized scrolling for large tables. Sort, filter (including raw WHERE), paginate, transpose, reorder columns, aggregate over selections (COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX), and copy anything.

**Inline editing** — Edit cells directly in the grid or open a row detail panel. Batch edit multiple rows. Insert, delete, review all pending changes before committing. Foreign key picker for related records.

**SQL editor** — Full CodeMirror editor with syntax highlighting, autocomplete, multi-statement execution, and EXPLAIN plan visualization. AI-assisted SQL generation from plain text. Transaction support with commit/rollback and a change log. Warns you before running destructive queries.

**Export & import** — Export to CSV, JSON, SQL INSERT, SQL UPDATE, Markdown, HTML, or XML. Configurable delimiters, encoding, and BOM. Preview before saving. Import from CSV and JSON.

**Navigation** — Connection tree with databases, schemas, and tables. Schema viewer showing columns, indexes, and foreign keys. Command palette, query history, saved views, bookmarks, cross-table search. Dark theme throughout.
